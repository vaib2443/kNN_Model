# kNN_Model
In this code, we explore the data set of senses adults where the target and the dependent
variable is the income and we will develop a productive model using the kNN, K nearest
neighbor algorithm to predict whether a person from the given data set or demographics has a
salary of more or less than 50K.
Steps used to create the model:
Part 1
1. Importing libraries and data set
2. Data cleaning
a. Renaming Columns and Resetting Index
b. Changing datatypes
c. Addressing missing values
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
a. Statistical Analysis
b. Histograms
c. Correlation Matrix
4. Feature engineering
5. Data pre-processing
a. Converting columns to binary values
b. Splitting the data set into training and test columns
c. Label encoding categorical values
d. Feature scaling
Part 2
1. Creating a kNN model using various K values
2. Comparing the models
3. Creating confusion metrics
